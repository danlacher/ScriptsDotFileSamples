# There is no place like 127.0.0.1

We are not headed to Kansas or Oz for this post but to my home network.  The landscape of my home networking setup (and lab) is an ever-evolving space so this snapshot in time will reflect as where I sit today.  Disclosure here that anyone else's milage may vary but this setup has proven well for a family, a geek's home lab, and all of the peripherals that come with a modern home with IOT automations.  I will say that I am a [Ubituiti](https://ui.com) fanboy which will become apparent as we go.  I will save the home desk setup and home automations for future posts; those could get lengthy if I pull them all into one.

## The Gear
- [Cloud Gateway Ultra](https://store.ui.com/us/en/products/ucg-ultra)
- [AC Long Range](https://store.ui.com/us/en/products/unifi-ac-lr)
- [AC Lite](https://store.ui.com/us/en/products/uap-ac-lite)
- [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/)

## The Setup
The setup from here is not overly complicated but it has come together over several iterations.  I make it complicated in the manners of trying to add additional layers of protection.  The computers, phones, smart things, IoT, ... almost all are on the wireless networks from here with a few items on physical ethernet.

That doesn't seem so bad... at this point it is fairly straight forward, the complexity does come as I said as I layer protection.

The Cloud Gateway broadcasts through the APs two SSID, one for home use and one for guest use.  The guest network has client device isolation enabled.  This additional protect would be nice to have for all of the IoT device as well but can cause some issues.  If enabled for items like a Smart TV then AirPlay and Chromecast can break... with that, the IoT devices in the home are mixed between the main network and the guest network.

The Raspberry Pi 4 is running [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) for DNS level web filtering.  As of the writing of this, I currently have 2,011,890 domains or sites blocked with the filtering.  The methods for blocking and allowing are posted [here](https://github.com/danlacher/ScriptsDotFileSamples/tree/master/Pihole) on my [GitHub](https://github.com/danlacher/).  The Cloud Gateway does have some of the filtering built in but this is a recent addition to the setup and has not been transitioned over yet.

There has to be more?  Yes, the whole set of IoT around home automation, geeky home lab, network storage, backup, ... It will be coming as well.
