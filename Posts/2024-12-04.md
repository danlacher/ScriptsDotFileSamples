# Restart of the brain dump...

Oh, the days when I used to blog to the world and overshare... yes, we all did it.  I started using a Java based blog software that [James Gosling](https://nighthacks.com) wrote.  The blog started internal at Sun Microsystems, moved external to [Blogs.Sun.COM](https://blogs.sun.com), and then over to a personal blog on [DanLacher.COM](http://danlacher.com) (currently under re-construction).  After all of the years of over sharing on those platforms, followed by the social media platforms, then I just dropped off.

## So why the return?

That is a great question, so why the return?  The hope is to be an outlet for thoughts, ideas, and knowledge that are trapped in my head.  For now I will get the data dumped into the "posts" with the hopes of getting the software pipelines stood up to go from [here](https://github.com/danlacher/ScriptsDotFileSamples/tree/master/Posts) to [DanLacher.COM](https://danlacher.com).  The software pipelines from GitHub to my domain will be something similar to [Network Chuck](https://networkchuck.com/) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8) but we shall see... it will end up being one of the posts to follow.

## What is the first brain dump?

I co-host an internal podcast at work and we almost always end up talking about the podcast that I am listening to.  That seems like a great dump that I can keep updated here for the fellow listeners and followers.  Some of these listed are not currently active but are great listens.
